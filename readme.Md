  var constructdb=new Xamsdb("michael",true)// use true for debug
  constructdb.AutoUpadateDB()
  let db=constructdb.db // any changes made to db or construct.db will be permanent
  
  
  this library is less than 3kb without any zip or minifying which make it an option and powerful 
  i argue with you that this is an option when it comes to javascript database library built on localstorage to store data seamlessly
